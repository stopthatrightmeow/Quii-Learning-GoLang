# Quii-Learning-Golang

This repository is to hold a copy of me learning from this awesome learning resource [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) made by [@quii](https://twitter.com/quii). I'll probably throw in some random stuff for references or websites used to fully understand how Go works. Coming from Python and looking at it, it's at least readable but structs have thrown me for a loop, and my editor seems to yeet unused chunks of code out. Ah well! It'll be fun to learn either way!

## My Goals

One of my goals by the end of this is to be able to create a basic web API that can be queried and provide information back to Logstash. In all actuality I don't need to write an application in Go to do this, BUT it gives me a reason to learn it. I have a tendency to drop stuff if there isn't an end goal in mind.
